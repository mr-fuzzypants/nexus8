i want to create a performant react table using the mantine UI library with the following features: * progressive, streamed rendering with large data sets * virtual scroling support * column managment/hiding * multi-grouping support (tree table) with drag-and-drop functionality * multi-sort * themes (dark and light themes). Tables need to be schema/data driven. It needs to be reusable, very performant for large numbers of rows (> 1000). 
Put code in a nexus8_frontend folder. Should resemble kendo grid.

⚙️ Feature Breakdown
Feature	Implementation Strategy
1. Progressive / Streamed Rendering	Use an API that returns JSON in chunks or NDJSON; parse and append rows as they arrive.
2. Virtual Scrolling	Use TanStack Virtual or React Virtuoso for windowed rendering of large tables.
3. Column Management / Hiding	Controlled column state in TanStack Table with Mantine <Menu> for toggles.
4. Multi-grouping (Tree Table)	TanStack Table’s getGroupedRowModel or hierarchical flattening logic.
5.Drag and Drop (for groups/columns)	Use @dnd-kit to reorder columns or drag group headers.
6. Multi-sort	Built-in support in TanStack Table.
7. Themes (Dark/Light)	Use Mantine’s theme system with a toggle.
8. Columns must be resizable
9. Must be a shareable/reusable Component
10. Must be model based with the ability to dyanmically create schemas and data
11. Must have a test data harness

🧱 Overall Architecture
1. Layer Responsibility	
    Use Mantine for  UI & Theming, Styling, layout, and theme switching	

2. Table Core
   Used TanStack Table (React Table v8) for	Data structure, sorting, grouping, column visibility	

3. Virtualization
  Use TanStack Virtual for Efficient large dataset rendering
 or React Virtuoso

4. @dnd-kit/core Use Drag & Drop Group and reorder rows/columns

This will be used with nexus8 backend ultimately, however I will need test data to test with.
